## What should I know before I get started?

### Project Structure

Our project uses discord.js v14, which means you should be familiar with modern JavaScript and Node.js. The main entry point of the bot is located in `index.js`, with commands and event handlers organized into separate directories.

### Development Environment

Ensure you have Node.js v16 or newer installed, as discord.js v14 requires it. Additionally, you'll need a Discord account and a test server to try out your changes.

## How Can I Contribute?
